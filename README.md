## What It Does

ApplyPilot is a 6-stage autonomous job application pipeline. It discovers jobs across 5+ boards, scores them against your resume with AI, tailors your resume per job, writes cover letters, and **submits applications for you**. It navigates forms, uploads documents, answers screening questions, all hands-free.

Three commands. That's it.

```bash
pip install applypilot
pip install --no-deps python-jobspy && pip install pydantic tls-client requests markdownify regex "curl_cffi>=0.16.2"
applypilot init          # one-time setup: resume, profile, preferences, API keys
applypilot doctor        # verify your setup — shows what's installed and what's missing
playwright install chromium  # browser used to read job pages
applypilot run           # discover > enrich > score > tailor > cover letters
applypilot run -w 4      # same but parallel (4 threads for discovery/enrichment)
applypilot apply         # autonomous browser-driven submission
applypilot apply -w 3    # parallel apply (3 Chrome instances)
applypilot apply --dry-run  # fill forms without submitting
```

> **Why two install commands?** `python-jobspy` pins an exact numpy version in its metadata that conflicts with pip's resolver, but works fine at runtime with any modern numpy. The `--no-deps` flag bypasses the resolver; the second command installs jobspy's actual runtime dependencies. Everything except `python-jobspy` installs normally.

## Two Paths

### Full Pipeline (recommended)
**Requires:** Python 3.11+, Node.js (for npx), Claude Code CLI (Pro/Max plan), Chrome

Runs all 6 stages, from job discovery to autonomous application submission. This is the full power of ApplyPilot.

### Discovery + Tailoring Only
**Requires:** Python 3.11+, and either Claude Code CLI or an LLM API key

Runs stages 1-5: discovers jobs, scores them, tailors your resume, generates cover letters. You submit applications manually with the AI-prepared materials.

---

## The Pipeline

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Discover** | Scrapes 5 job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs) + 48 Workday employer portals + 30 direct career sites |
| **2. Enrich** | Fetches full job descriptions via JSON-LD, CSS selectors, or AI-powered extraction |
| **3. Score** | AI rates every job 1-10 based on your resume and preferences. Only high-fit jobs proceed |
| **4. Tailor** | AI rewrites your resume per job: reorganizes, emphasizes relevant experience, adds keywords. Never fabricates |
| **5. Cover Letter** | AI generates a targeted cover letter per job |
| **6. Auto-Apply** | Claude Code navigates application forms, fills fields, uploads documents, answers questions, and submits |

Each stage is independent. Run them all or pick what you need.

## Requirements

| Component | Required For | Details |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Python 3.11+ | Everything | Core runtime |
| Node.js 18+ | Auto-apply | Needed for `npx` to run Playwright MCP server |
| LLM | Scoring, tailoring, cover letters | Claude Code CLI (uses your plan, no key), or a Gemini/OpenAI key, or a local model |
| Chrome/Chromium | Auto-apply | Auto-detected on most systems |
| Claude Code CLI | Auto-apply | Install from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) |

**Claude is the default LLM when Claude Code is installed.** Scoring, tailoring and cover letters run through `claude -p` on your Claude subscription: Haiku for scoring and extraction, Sonnet for tailoring, cover letters and the fabrication judge. Each call runs with no tools, no MCP servers and none of your hooks or CLAUDE.md (`--safe-mode --tools ""`). Override a task's model with `CLAUDE_MODEL_<TASK>` (e.g. `CLAUDE_MODEL_TAILOR=opus`). If you hit your plan's usage limit, the stage stops and unprocessed jobs wait for the next run.

Gemini ([aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)), OpenAI and local models (Ollama/llama.cpp) are still supported: set their key, or force one with `LLM_PROVIDER=claude|gemini|openai|local`.

### Optional

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `APPLYPILOT_ENABLE_GMAIL=1` | Lets the apply agent read (never send) Gmail to fetch email verification codes |

### Auto-apply safety model (this fork)

- The apply agent can only drive its own browser. Shell, file and web-fetch tools are denied.
- Worker browsers use their own profile, never your everyday Chrome. Sign in to job sites once by hand in the worker browser; sessions are reused.
- It never types passwords, creates accounts, sends email, or solves CAPTCHAs.
- Every screening answer comes from your `profile.json`. If a required fact is missing, the job is queued as `manual` with the question, instead of guessed.

> **Note:** python-jobspy is installed separately with `--no-deps` because it pins an exact numpy version in its metadata that conflicts with pip's resolver. It works fine with modern numpy at runtime.

## Configuration

All generated by `applypilot init`:

### `profile.json`
Your personal data in one structured file: contact info, work authorization, compensation, experience, skills, resume facts (preserved during tailoring), and EEO defaults. Powers scoring, tailoring, and form auto-fill.

### `searches.yaml`
Job search queries, target titles, locations, boards. Run multiple searches with different parameters.

### `.env`
Runtime config: `LLM_PROVIDER`, `CLAUDE_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_MODEL_<TASK>`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`, `APPLYPILOT_ENABLE_GMAIL` (all optional).

### Package configs (shipped with ApplyPilot)
- `config/employers.yaml` - Workday employer registry (48 preconfigured)
- `config/sites.yaml` - Direct career sites (30+), blocked sites, base URLs, manual ATS domains
- `config/searches.example.yaml` - Example search configuration

## How Stages Work

### Discover
Queries Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs via JobSpy. Scrapes 48 Workday employer portals (configurable in `employers.yaml`). Hits 30 direct career sites with custom extractors. Deduplicates by URL.

### Enrich
Visits each job URL and extracts the full description. 3-tier cascade: JSON-LD structured data, then CSS selector patterns, then AI-powered extraction for unknown layouts.

### Score
AI scores every job 1-10 against your profile. 9-10 = strong match, 7-8 = good, 5-6 = moderate, 1-4 = skip. Only jobs above your threshold proceed to tailoring.

### Tailor
Generates a custom resume per job: reorders experience, emphasizes relevant skills, incorporates keywords from the job description. Your `resume_facts` (companies, projects, metrics) are preserved exactly. The AI reorganizes but never fabricates.

### Cover Letter
Writes a targeted cover letter per job referencing the specific company, role, and how your experience maps to their requirements.

### Auto-Apply
Claude Code launches a Chrome instance, navigates to each application page, detects the form type, fills personal information and work history, uploads the tailored resume and cover letter, answers screening questions from your profile, and submits. Anything it can't do honestly (CAPTCHA, login wall, unanswered question, email-only application) is queued as `manual` for you. A live dashboard shows progress in real-time.

The Playwright MCP server is configured automatically at runtime per worker. No manual MCP setup needed.

```bash
# Utility modes (no Chrome/Claude needed)
applypilot apply --mark-applied URL    # manually mark a job as applied
applypilot apply --mark-failed URL     # manually mark a job as failed
applypilot apply --reset-failed        # reset all failed jobs for retry
applypilot apply --gen --url URL       # generate prompt file for manual debugging
```
